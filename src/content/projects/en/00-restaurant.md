Website for a small restaurant using **Astro**, **React**, **Tailwind**, and **Firebase**. The public pages allow customers to view the menu and check the restaurant's location. The administrator has access to a **backend**, where they can update the daily menu through a simple interface with **Firebase** authentication.
